Welcome to the frontend repository for EmployeeShift, a dynamic web application built with ReactJS, designed to manage employee shifts effortlessly. This application interfaces easily with a .NET backend via Axios for API calls, enhancing real-time data interaction and management.

## Features

- **React Router**: Utilized for enhanced navigation and routing throughout the application.
  
- **Axios**: Employed for API requests, ensuring efficient and manageable asynchronous HTTP requests.
  
- **Proxy Configuration**: Modify the `proxy` setting in `package.json` to redirect API requests to the correct server, allowing for secure HTTPS URLs.
  
- **Local Storage and Prompts**: Used for minor state management tasks like storing user IDs and other session-related data.

## Project Structure

The source code is organized into two main directories within the `src` folder:
- **components**: Contains reusable components used across different parts of the application.
- **pages**: Houses the logic and layout for entire pages, ensuring a clean separation of concerns.

## Key Sections and Functionality

- **Home Page**: Welcoming page that explains further steps.

- **Employee Login**: Employees can log in directly from the main page using their employee ID to access their personal shift information.
  
- **Employee Shift Register**: Employees can record their arrival and departure times, with the system verifying the accuracy of the timing against the scheduled shifts.
  
- **Work Status Overview**: For employees currently logged in, the interface displays the duration of the current work session with options to sign off or update their status.
  
- **Manager Login**: Securely log in to access the system and manage employee information and schedules.
  
- **Manager Home - Personal Details**: View personal information of the manager using the application.
  
- **Manager Edit Personal Info**: Edit personal information of the manager using the application.
  
- **Add Employee**: Enables managers to add new employees, specifying details such as workdays, shifts, and wage information, along with generating unique employee IDs.
  
- **Insights**: View all events related to employees such as when they have left work, were they late or not, etc.
  
- **View Employees**: View all employees and search if needed, with additional functionality to view details, edit or delete employees.
  
- **View Details of a Specific Employee**
  
- **Edit Details of a Specific Employee**
  
- **Delete Employee**
